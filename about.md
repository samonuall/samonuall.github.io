I'm a computer science and economics student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Currently I am working as a software engineer intern at Lockheed Martin Space working on the software for a satellite tech demo for the summer. I am interested in machine learning / AI and am working on some projects to learn more, which I talk a little about on this website.
