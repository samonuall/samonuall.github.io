# Problem Definitiomn #
For an honors colloquium for my Algorithms class (CS 311), I was tasked with completing a final project with algorithm design and analysis as the focus. This project is my attempt at making a graph-based algorithm for reducing echo chambers in collaberative filtering reccomendation algorithms. Echo chambers in social media are a problem known by anyone regardless of technical background - it is easy to see how social media algorithms can feed people content and communities that conform to one form of thought and prevent people from any opposing views. **By forcing users to be exposed to content that is different from their normal echo chambers, yet is proven to still appeal to people like them and "bridge the gap" between communities, then maybe this problem can be mitigated.**


# Dataset #
I use the Book Crossing dataset for testing my theory, which is a dataset of book ratings, book information, and demographics about users.

Book-Crossing dataset (source: http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/):


# Abstract #
The main idea of my algorithm is to create a graph of book ratings, where nodes represent discrete users and links between users represent those two users have a minimum number of shared books rated. The weight of these links represents the mean squared error between shared book ratings between users, allowing this graph to represent the similarity/difference between user preferences of books. From here, I use an algorithm I created to try and find which books/users seem to "cross the gap" between users who otherwise have extremely different content preferences but seem to both have similarities between another user or book. From there I reccomend the highest rated books of this user that "crosses the gap."
