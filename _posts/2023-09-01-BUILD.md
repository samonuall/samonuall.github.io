# Project Description #
Starting Spring 23, a new UMass Professor came to BUILD UMass looking to create a website for her research program. This website needs to be customizable by non-technical members of the lab in the future, and adhere to design specifications. We want to create a website from scratch implementing frontend and backend using React, Contentful, Material UI, and Javascript. 

# My Work #
Lead a team of 7 in a pro-bono tech consulting group to build and launch a full stack website for a UMass research group
Coordinate with client, run weekly standup meetings, and assign tasks for frontend and backend
Designing and implementing website software primarily on the frontend, and recently delivered an MVP to client
